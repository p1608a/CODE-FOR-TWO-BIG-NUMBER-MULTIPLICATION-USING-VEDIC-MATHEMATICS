**An Efficient Multiplication algorithm using Urdhava Tiryakbhyam( Vedic math)**

Multiplication is the essential and abundant part of DSP applications. There  are different types of multiplication technique are used to perform various 
applications. ex-Array multipliers.  The speed of multiplication is  improved by  Vedic Multiplication Technique so that it can be used in very complex  
multiplication based systems.ex-RSA,ECC etc. RSA algorithm is one such  popular algorithm which is used for security of networks. It includes several 
time consuming exponentiation operations based on multiplications.  Therefore the proposed algorithm for multiplication based on Urdhva 
Tiryagbhyam Sutra is applied to RSA to enhance the speed of operation.  Keywords: Cipher text, Modular exponentiation, RSA algorithm, Urdhva tiryagbhyam sutra, Vedic multiplier

**INTRODUCTION**

Multiplication technique plays an important role in today’s digital signal processing and various other applications. The implementation efficiency and performance 
of systems are dependent on the efficiency of the multiplication. Array multiplier and Vedic multiplier  are the different types of multipliers.
Vedic multiplier is based on Indian  Vedic Mathematics. The Sanskrit word “Veda” means “Knowledge” and it consists of large number of 
documents. Vedic Mathematics is the name given by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha Maharaj. The application of the high speed multiplier mainly includes the 
cryptographic systems. Cryptography is the science of using mathematical equations for encryption and decryption of data. By 
using this technique, the information cannot be read by unintended recipients. Public key cryptography and private key cryptography are 
the two kinds of cryptographic techniques. Public key cryptography system is a well-known method which is used in many applications 
such as smart cards, digital certificates etc. RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman algorithm) is one of the widely used 
public key algorithms developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman. It is one of the simplest and safest algorithms 
that use different keys for encryption and decryption. The most time consuming operation in RSA algorithm is modular exponentiation 
operations that include several modular multiplication operations. This algorithm is used here to speed up the operation thus the 
overall system provides an efficient technique for enhancing security in networks.

**Urdhava Tiryakbhyam**

Urdhava Tiryakbhyam Sutra, which literally means “Vertically and crosswise”, is a general 
multiplication formula applicable to all cases of multiplication. This Sutra highlights parallelism in 
generation of partial products and their summation.
